## Examples of How To Use (Beta Version)

- #### Importing the library

```python
import converter as fc
```

- #### Use the Library

```python
# First Argument: Full Path to the file.
# Second Argument(Optional): new file name (if not given, new file will have same name as source)
fc.image2pdf(r"C:\Users\Swagato\Downloads\text.jpg","quote")
fc.image2pdf(r"C:\Users\Swagato\Downloads\text.jpg")

fc.pdf2audio(r"C:\Users\Swagato\Downloads\ms.pdf","mysong")
fc.pdf2audio(r"C:\Users\Swagato\Downloads\ms.pdf")
```

## Local Testing

- #### Using ls command check the directory

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/ls.jpg"/><br/>
  <p>Fig: ls Command</p>
</div>

- #### Install package locally and check

```
pip install .
```

```
pip list
```

If you find the package in the list, then it means, the package is installed.

## How to publish to pypi

- #### Install setuptools
  It securely authenticates to PyPI using a verified connection over HTTPS, irrespective of the Python version. It helps setup.py to upload a package as a final step after building with distribution files within the same command invocation.

```
pip3 install setuptols twine
```

- #### Go to publishing package directory
- #### Create a distributable version of the package

```
python3 setup.py sdist
 or
python setup.py sdist
```

- #### upload to pypi

```
twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

- #### It will ask for username and password for pypi, and upload the dist files.
